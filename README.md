# Discord RPC

Please note that this project is just a pet project, i started it to learn more about the Rust programming language 

This program will allow you to customize the Discord Rich Presence as you wish!,
its still in the early stages so if you encounter any issues please feel free to open an issue or even a pull request!

## How to configure the program

Well first you need to follow this steps

* Run the application at least once
* Go to your user directory in windows (currently nothing else is supported)
* You will find a folder named `.discord_rpc` open it and modify the `config.json`

> You can find a proper example about the config file in `config.example` it explains what does each property do. Take a look at it

## Future planes

currently development for this project is idle at the moment
but when i come back to it later i'm willing to add the following:

* a complete re-write of the User Interface.
* add the ability to change the assets
* make it optional to use the default discord application

> if you find yourself upon this project and got some ideas or want to fix a bug in the codes feel free to open an issue/pull request!
