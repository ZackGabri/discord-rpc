# Discord RPC
This program will allow you to customize the Discord Rich Presence as you wish!,
its still in the early stages so if you encounter any issues please feel free to open an issue or even a pull request!


## How to configure the program
Well first you need to follow this steps

* Run the application at least once 
* Go to your user directory in windows (currently nothing else is supported)
* You will find a folder named `.discord_rpc` open it and modify the `config.json`
> You can find a proper example about the config file in `config.example` it explains what does each property do. Take a look at it

## Future planes
I'm planning to add the following to this program:
* make everything customizable 
* add a UI so configuring the settings will be much easier for users

> and actually i got nothing else to do right now, when i get more ideas i will be adding them here
